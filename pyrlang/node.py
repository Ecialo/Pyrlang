        must outlive all other objects it manages, for them to be accessible
        over the network.

        Usage example:

        1. Create a node class with a name and a cookie
            ``node = Pyrlang.Node("py@127.0.0.1", "COOKIE")``
        2. Start it with ``node.start()`` - this will spawn an asyncio task
        3. Now run asyncio loop and the Node will do its thing in the background
